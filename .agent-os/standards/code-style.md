## Code Style & Conventions

- **File Structure**: Adhere strictly to the Next.js App Router conventions (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `route.ts`). Place reusable components in the `components/` directory.
- **Component Design**: Build UI by composing small, single-purpose components from `shadcn/ui` and Radix UI.
