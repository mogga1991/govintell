# Product Mission

## Pitch

GovIntelligence is an AI-powered SaaS tool that helps small businesses find relevant government RFQs and automatically generate competitive quotes by sourcing products and calculating margins to win more government contracts.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Small Business Government Contractors**: Business owners who resell commercial off-the-shelf products to government agencies
- **Government Resellers**: Companies specializing in fulfilling government procurement needs through commercial suppliers

### User Personas

**Government Contractor Business Owner** (35-55 years old)
- **Role:** Small Business Owner/Government Contractor
- **Context:** Operates a business that bids on government contracts, particularly during busy fiscal year periods
- **Pain Points:** Time-consuming RFQ discovery process, manual product sourcing research, complex quote calculations
- **Goals:** Increase bid volume, reduce time per quote, improve profit margins, win more contracts

## The Problem

### Manual RFQ Discovery is Time-Consuming

Small business owners spend hours daily searching through multiple government portals (SAM.gov, DIBBS) to find relevant opportunities that match their capabilities. This manual process results in missed opportunities and inefficient use of limited business resources.

**Our Solution:** Automated RFQ discovery integrates with government APIs to pull relevant opportunities based on user-defined criteria.

### Product Sourcing Research is Labor-Intensive

For each RFQ, contractors must manually research the exact products requested and find suppliers with current pricing information. This research can take 2-4 hours per quote, limiting the number of bids a small business can submit.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered product sourcing automatically identifies requested products and finds suppliers with pricing information.

### Quote Calculation is Error-Prone

Manual calculation of competitive quotes while maintaining desired profit margins often leads to mathematical errors or non-competitive pricing that results in lost bids.

**Our Solution:** Margin-based quote generation automatically calculates competitive pricing based on supplier costs and desired margins.

## Differentiators

### AI-Powered Automation vs Manual Research

Unlike traditional government contracting approaches that rely on manual research and Excel spreadsheets, we provide end-to-end automation from opportunity discovery to quote generation. This results in 90% time savings and 300% increase in bid capacity.

### Real-Time Government API Integration

Unlike competitors who provide static lists or delayed updates, we integrate directly with live government APIs (SAM.gov, DIBBS) to provide real-time opportunities. This results in first-mover advantage on new RFQs and higher win rates.

### Commercial Supplier Network Access

Unlike government-only platforms, we bridge the gap between commercial suppliers and government requirements by automatically sourcing products from the broader commercial marketplace. This results in better pricing and product availability.
