# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Authentication and Onboarding
> Created: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Implement a flexible authentication system supporting both GitHub and email/password login with a streamlined onboarding flow for government contractors. This feature enables immediate access to RFQ browsing while encouraging profile completion through in-app prompts for better filtered results.

## User Stories

### Contractor Quick Start Authentication

As a government contractor, I want to quickly sign up using either my email or GitHub account, so that I can start browsing RFQs immediately without lengthy verification processes.

The user visits the platform, chooses their preferred authentication method (GitHub OAuth or email/password), completes basic signup, and gains immediate access to browse available RFQs while being prompted to complete their business profile for enhanced filtering.

### Business Profile Completion

As a government contractor, I want to add my company name and primary NAICS codes after initial signup, so that I receive better-targeted RFQ recommendations.

After signing up, users see in-app prompts encouraging them to complete their business profile. They can add company name and select primary NAICS codes, which immediately improves their RFQ search results and recommendations.

### Seamless Post-Registration Experience

As a government contractor, I want to complete business verification details at my own pace after registration, so that I'm not blocked from exploring the platform's core value.

Users can access all browsing features immediately after authentication. Business verification prompts appear contextually, and users can complete SAM.gov registration details when ready without losing access to platform features.

## Spec Scope

1. **Dual Authentication Methods** - Support both GitHub OAuth and traditional email/password registration with NextAuth.js integration
2. **Immediate Platform Access** - Allow users to browse RFQs and explore core features immediately after basic authentication
3. **Progressive Profile Building** - Implement in-app prompts for company name and NAICS code collection without blocking core functionality
4. **Business Verification Flow** - Create post-registration prompts for SAM.gov details and business verification without requiring completion
5. **Single-User Account Structure** - Focus on individual contractor accounts with clean user profile management

## Out of Scope

- Multi-factor authentication implementation
- Team/multi-user account functionality
- Real-time SAM.gov API verification during signup
- Advanced contractor certification tracking
- Subscription management integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional authentication system supporting both GitHub and email/password login accessible through clean signup/signin pages
2. Users can immediately browse RFQs after completing basic authentication without profile completion requirements
3. In-app prompts guide users to add company name and NAICS codes with immediate improvement to RFQ filtering and recommendations
