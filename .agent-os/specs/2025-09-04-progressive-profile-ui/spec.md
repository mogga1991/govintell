## Overview

Complete the progressive profile UI system that allows government contractors to enhance their profiles gradually while maintaining immediate access to RFQ browsing and quote generation features.

## User Stories

### Progressive Profile Enhancement
As a government contractor, I want to complete my business profile progressively through contextual prompts, so that I can access RFQs immediately while gradually improving my matching accuracy.

The user can browse RFQs immediately after signup, receives helpful completion prompts throughout the platform, and sees how profile completion improves their RFQ matching without blocking their access to core functionality.

### Business Profile Management
As a government contractor, I want an intuitive interface to manage my company information and NAICS codes, so that I can accurately represent my business capabilities for better RFQ matching.

Users can easily update company details, select relevant NAICS codes through a searchable interface, and understand how their profile completeness affects RFQ recommendations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Profile Completion Components** - Build user-friendly form components for company profile management
2. **Contextual Completion Prompts** - Implement non-blocking prompts throughout the platform that encourage profile completion
3. **RFQ Integration Points** - Connect profile completion status with RFQ browsing and filtering experience
4. **Progress Tracking UI** - Visual indicators showing profile completion status and benefits

## Out of Scope

- Core authentication system modifications (already complete)
- Database schema changes (already implemented)
- NAICS data management (already implemented)
- API endpoint development (already complete)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can complete their business profile through intuitive form components
2. Profile completion prompts appear contextually without blocking access to RFQ features
3. Profile completion status is clearly visible and tied to RFQ filtering improvements
