# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: RFQ Management & Browsing Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec defines the comprehensive RFQ (Request for Quote) management and browsing system that enables users to discover, track, and manage government contracting opportunities. The system leverages the existing user profile completion framework to provide intelligent matching and personalized recommendations.

The RFQ management system will serve as the core value proposition of the platform, transforming how contractors find and pursue government opportunities by providing advanced search capabilities, intelligent matching algorithms, and automated opportunity tracking.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**As a government contractor**, I want to search and filter RFQs by multiple criteria (NAICS codes, PSC codes, location, contract value, deadline) so that I can quickly find opportunities that match my business capabilities.

**As a business owner**, I want to see a matching score for each RFQ based on my company profile so that I can prioritize which opportunities to pursue.

**As a contractor**, I want to save and bookmark interesting RFQs so that I can easily return to them later and track their status.

**As a busy entrepreneur**, I want to receive email alerts for high-match opportunities so that I never miss relevant RFQs that could grow my business.

**As a project manager**, I want to track the status of RFQs I'm pursuing (watched, applied, won, lost) so that I can manage my pipeline effectively.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a data-driven contractor**, I want to see historical performance data for agencies and contracting opportunities so that I can make informed bidding decisions.

**As a team member**, I want to collaborate with colleagues on RFQ evaluation and tracking so that we can coordinate our business development efforts.

**As a contractor**, I want to export RFQ data and create custom reports so that I can analyze market trends and opportunities.
